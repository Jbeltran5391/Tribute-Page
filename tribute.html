      <h3><u>Interesting facts about ASIMO</u></h3>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li><strong>1980's</strong> - Honda began developing human-like robots. This included begining prototypes of ASIMO.</li>
        <li><strong>1986 & 1993</strong> - E0 was the first two legged robotic model created. The early experiments involved self-regulating, humanoid walking robots with wireless movements. This was the introduction towards the Honda E series.</li>
        <li><strong>1993-1997</strong> - The Honda P series of robots were in production. The research made on the E- and P-series led to the creation of ASIMO.</li>
        <li><strong>1999</strong> - Development began at Honda's Wako Fundamental Technical Research Center in Japan.</li>
        <li><strong>2000</strong> - Honda unveils ASIMO.</li>
        <li>ASIMO stands 130 cm (4 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 54 kg (119 lb).</li>
        <li>ASIMO is powered by a rechargeable 51.8 V lithium-ion battery with an operating time of one hour. Switching from a nickel metal hydride in 2004 increased the amount of time ASIMO can operate before recharging.</li>
        <li>The computer that controls ASIMO's movement is housed in the robot's waist area and can be controlled by a PC, wireless controller, or voice commands.</li>
        <li>ASIMO has the ability to recognize moving objects, postures, gestures, its surrounding environment, sounds and faces, which enables it to interact with humans.</li>
        <li>The robot can detect the movements of multiple objects by using visual information captured by two camera "eyes" in its head and also determine distance and direction.</li>
        <li>The robot interprets voice commands and human gestures, enabling it to recognize when a handshake is offered or when a person waves or points, and then respond accordingly.</li>
        <li>There are sensors that assist in autonomous navigation. The two cameras inside the head are used as a visual sensor to detect obstacles. The lower portion of the torso has ground sensor which comprises one laser sensor and one infrared sensor.</li>
        <li>The laser sensor is used to detect ground surface. The infrared sensor with automatic shutter adjustment based on brightness is used to detect pairs of floor markings to confirm the navigable paths of the planned map.</li>
        <li>The pre-loaded map and the detection of floor markings help the robot to precisely identify its present location and continuously adjusting its position.</li>
        <li>There are front and rear ultrasonic sensors to sense the obstacles. The front sensor is located at the lower portion of the torso together with the ground sensor. The rear sensor is located at the bottom of the backpack.</li>
